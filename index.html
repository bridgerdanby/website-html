        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a third year student at BYU studying computer science. I am also pursing minors
          in business and math. I am on BYU's Formula E team. Our goal is to build a small 
          fully electric formula style car to compete in SAE's collegate competion. We are using
          Teensie microcontrollers to control the car and log data that will help anylize our 
          design and improve our understanding of vehicle dynamics. I am also participating in
          next year's Sandbox cohort. Sandbox is an incubator for student owned software companies. 
          I don't know exactly what I will be working on, but I have an excellent team that I 
          look forward to working with.

          Outside of school I love skiing, hiking and camping. I try to get outside as much as possible. 
          I did FIRST robotics in highschool and I like to run.
